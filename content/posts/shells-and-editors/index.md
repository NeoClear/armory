> Just a tiny post about my personal preferences for devtools

### Shell
I chose zsh. I used to believe fish is faster than zsh and more feature-rich, but my own tiny benchmark script indicates the opposite. Also, fish does not support a lot of standard shell script syntax, making it less universal compared to other shells. Another script from github indicates zsh is also faster than bash for most of the cases, and the benchmark script fails on fish. So I chose zsh.

### Editor
I chose zed. It is fast, written in Rust, not based on web technologies, and has a nice logo. I haven't benchmarked it yet, but I trust their claim.
