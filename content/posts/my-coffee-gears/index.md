## Brief
I've changed how I interpret coffee gear markets after coming back to China. Things have changed.

### China Coffee Market
#### Coffee Grinder Market
High-end coffee grinders are expensive in EU/NA market. However, a pretty good 98mm flat burr ultra grinder is produced by multiple individual manufacturers in China (dont worry about copyright) with quite reasonable price. You can pay as little as 1k USD for an ultra grinder with SSP burr installed. On the other hand, the price for EG-1 80mm flat burr is 4k usd, using a less powerful brushless motor. Does ER-1 last longer and has better build quality? No.

Overall, I like the coffee grinder market in China. Good quality with cheap price.

#### Espresso Machine
Not as good as grinder market. Things are cheap, but there is concern in quality.

#### Coffee Beans
As expensive as EU/NA

#### Conclusion
Buy coffee grinder from China. They might not have a big brand & doesn't have a website, but their gears are good and cheap. Just to let you know, a lot of big brands are actually manufactured in China.

## My gears
Gonna cancel my Z1 order. I preordered it for it's design, blind burr, small form-factor, and easy burr swap, but I am not willing to tolerate it's drawback when I had a chance to look into Chinese coffee grinder market. I don't like: expensive price, 64mm burr, black finish, mostly alum in it's core components.

I'm planning to get a 98mm Ye ultra grinder, and a 64mm Lagom p64 grinder. It's hard to find one grinder that meets all my requirements, and I can use them for both filter & espresso.

Blind burr: ultra
Capable of resell: p64
great value per dollar: ultra
Great build quality: both
Big burr: ultra

## Burr Selection
There is espresso burr, there is filter burr, and there is universal burr. But if you want the best for both, get 2 burr sets.
Also, the universal lab sweet burr is usually easy to catch fines, if you want a clean grinder, get either espresso-focused or filter-focused.
