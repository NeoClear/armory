## Principles
> 1. Build for long term use
> 2. Upgradeable
> 3. Maintainable
> 4. Efficient

I wish I took photos of the process, but I was too busy building it.

## Flaws
1. ITX motherboard is a bit small for proper motherboard power cable management.
2. Did not connect all the front panel connectors. I will connect all of them once a new motherboard is installed.
3. I've tried my best to arrange cable managemetn, but it is still a bit messy. I will try to improve it when new cooler arrives.
4. AIO water cooler has the wrong orientation.

## Advantages
1. PA602 and 1000W PSU with ATX 3.0 spec provides great extensibility for future upgrades.
2. The entire upgrade is cheap, with the cost of only a new case, a new PSU and a new nvme SSD.

## PSU
Chose Seasonic Focus GX-1000, with 80 Plus Gold certification. I do not see it as an overkill, as a potential RTX 5090 requires huge power.

## Notes For Future Upgrades
1. Keep the manual and the screws for your components: you will need it for future upgrades.
2. Keep practice and always thrive to improve the installation, and make the build maintainable along the way. Do not rush!
3. Think ahead and avoid issues before they happen.
