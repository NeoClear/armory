## Brief
There are different types of coffee:

1. Espresso
2. Filter coffee

I mostly drink espresso, as it takes less time to produce. Filter coffee works better if you want to taste the flavor of high-quality coffee beans like Geisha.

## Espresso Equipments
### Espresso Machine
#### Functionalities
1. **PID**: For better temperature control.
2. **OPV**: You can adjust the pressure on the brew head.
3. **Grouphead**: There are different types of groupheads. Check for compatibility before you choose a machine or coffee gears.
4. **Pump**: Rotery pump; viberate pump. Rotery pump is better.
5. **Boiler**: Single/dual boiler; Boiler heated or heating block.
6. **Build quality**: What material is used. Brass (better maluability, cheaper, better heat retention) is definitely fine for the espresso machine, but stainless steel (healthier? more expensive) is better.

#### Models For Recommendation
> Entry levels
1. Rancilio Silvia M V6
    * Pros:
        * Good build quality
        * Reliable and consistent, proved by time
        * Worth the money at the pricepoint
        * Lightweight as a good espresso machine
    * Cons:
        * Outdated design
        * Not too much control to the user
        * Grouphead is somewhat E61 compatible, but not entirely
        * The factory screw for the grouphead looks bad
2. Profitec Go
    * Pros:
        * Slightly more expensive than Rancilio Silvia, but has both PID & OPV

        * Modern design
    * Cons:
        * Quality not proved by time
        * Also brass boiler
        * Probably E61 compatible, but not 100%

3. Ascaso Steel Duo Plus
    * Pros:
        * I like the design

### Coffee Grinders
#### Theory
1. We need the grinder because grounded coffee lose their flavor over time, you need to grind fresh to get the best out of coffee beans
2. Particles from grinding matters, burrs matter, burr alignment matters, grinding speed matters
3. Bean > grinder > espresso machine
4. Espresso & filter coffee require different burr sets. Espresso need more fine particles, while filter want less fines. Espresso grinds finer.
5. Burr size matters

#### What To Look For
1. Motor type: brushed, brushless, servos
2. Alignment
3. Serviceability
4. Build quality
5. Prebreaker
6. Bean feed rate controller (auger)

#### Models For Recommendation
> Entry Levels
1. DF64 Gen 2
    * Pros:
        * Good value per dollar
    * Cons:
        * Dimension a bit big for the burr size
2. DF64V
    * Pros:
        * Brushless motor
        * Better look
        * Smaller form-factor
        * Metal (likely alum alloy) chute
    * Cons:
        * Beans may stuck

Other than the above 2, there is no good entry-level grinder (from my perspective)
