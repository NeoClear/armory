## Intro
Doctor fix your bones, physio fix your muscles. For young people, the problem is usually with the muscle

## Principles
1. People think moving your body in a certain way is easy. It is not. Training is usually required.
2. People are borned differently. Some have better neural recruitment ability, some have worse. It is easier for people with better ability to move joints in the right way inheritly.
3. Relax your muscle is important. A hard muscle has worse elasticity, thus giving your joint more pressure. Relax your muscle before workout is more important than after.
4. Relaxing your muscle can be painful. Message gun is usually not sufficient. If you don't find relaxing painful, it's likely that you're not doing it the right way.
5. A physio or trainer is important. A good trainer tells you the right way to do a certain exercise. Again, you need to find a GOOD trainer.
6. You may wanna train multiple parts of your body all at once, and you may find that more efficient. Don't do that. Tightening one part of your muscle may obstacle your movement and cause pain on your joint.
7. Moving fast is not necessarily bad. Don't be afraid of moving fast. Again, ask your physio for confirmation. You may do it the wrong way.
8. Do the things you can do, and don't feel bad about your limitations. It is extremely hard for a thin guy to gain lots of strength.
9. Sometimes the pain comes from your brain control. Your brain is afraid of the pain coming from the movement, so the joint gets locked on a certain angle. Train your brain so that muscle don't fight each other.
10. When supporting your body, your core should be the part that provides the support, and distal limb shouldn't support.

## Joints
### Knee
1. Relax your muscle
2. If your petella glides through the outside of femoral trochlea, make your quadriceps strong enough so the petella is pulled more to the inside so that the pain shrinks.
3. Make sure you're pain-free throughout your exercises.

### Elbow
1. Usually elbow won't have problems with joint structures. It's usually tendon, ligament and muscle problem.
2. When doing pushups, use your chest and triceps. Do not use your forearm. Using your forearm in pushups would overtight your elbow and could potentially cause pain.
